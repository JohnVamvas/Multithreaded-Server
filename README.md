# Multithreaded-Server
Implementation of a multithreaded server that allows multiple users to make requests at the same time. Each user can request access to the database and the request can be PUT or GET. The implementation makes use of the reader/writter logic where only one writter can modify the database or multiple readers can access it and read data at the same time, as well as the producer/consumer logic to synchronize the incoming requests. Also the implementation gives priority to readers. For the tests, a multithreaded client is used to establish a TCP Connection over the server and start feeding requests.
